Smart Learning Assistant Platform
Mobile Application Development – Final Coursework Specification (Full-Marks Targeted)

1. Project Overview
Domain: Education & Learning
Platform: Cross-platform Mobile Application
Framework: Flutter (Dart)
State Management: Provider / Riverpod
Backend: RESTful API Layer
Database: Firebase Firestore (Cloud Database with Offline Persistence)
Architecture Pattern: Clean Architecture with Feature-Based Modular Structure
The Smart Learning Assistant Platform is a comprehensive mobile learning application designed to enhance student learning through structured courses, interactive lessons, quizzes, personal notes, progress tracking, notifications, and an AI-powered chatbot.
The application follows an industry-standard, API-driven architecture, where all data operations are performed through REST APIs connected to Firebase Firestore. The system supports offline-first functionality using Firestore’s built-in local caching and automatic data synchronisation, ensuring seamless user experience regardless of connectivity.

2. Objectives of the Application
The key objectives of this project are:
* To design and develop a real-world mobile learning platform
* To implement full CRUD functionality via REST APIs
* To use Firebase Firestore as the single centralized database
* To ensure the entire frontend communicates with one backend
* To support offline-first access with automatic online synchronisation
* To apply Clean Architecture and state management best practices
* To provide separate Student and Administrator modules
* To demonstrate professional-level Flutter application development

3. Main Functional Features
Core Application Features
1. AI Chatbot Assistant
2. Course Management
3. Lessons and Topics
4. Quiz Module
5. Notes Management
6. Progress Tracking
7. Notifications
8. User and Admin Management
Each feature is implemented using API-based CRUD operations and follows a consistent architectural approach.

4. Offline and Online Feature Classification
4.1 Offline-Enabled Features (Exactly 8)
The following eight features are fully functional both offline and online, using Firebase Firestore offline persistence:
1. View enrolled courses
2. View downloaded lessons
3. Read lesson content
4. Create personal notes
5. Edit personal notes
6. Delete personal notes
7. View quiz history and scores
8. View learning progress
Offline Behaviour:
* Data reads are served from Firestore’s local cache
* Data writes are stored locally as pending operations
Online Synchronisation:
* When connectivity is restored, Firestore automatically synchronises local changes to the cloud
* Conflict resolution is handled by Firestore’s last-write-wins mechanism
This design satisfies the coursework requirement for offline support and data synchronisation.

4.2 Online-Only Features
The following features require an active internet connection:
* AI chatbot interactions
* Course enrolment
* Quiz attempts and submissions
* Administrator CRUD operations
* User authentication and authorization
* Push notification delivery
* Reports and analytics

5. Application Architecture

7. Screens / Pages
Student Screens
* Login & Registration
* Home Dashboard
* Course List
* Lesson Viewer
* Quiz Screen
* Notes Manager
* Progress Tracker
* Chatbot
* Profile managment
* Settings (dark mode, language tranlation)
* Show all notifications
Administrator Screens
* Admin Dashboard
* Course Management (CRUD)
* Lesson Management (CRUD)
* Quiz Management (CRUD)
* User Management
* Reports & Analytics
* Send notification
The application contains more than the required minimum of five independent screens.

8. Database Design – Firebase Firestore
Firestore Collections
* users
* courses
* lessons
* quizzes
* quiz_results
* notes
* progress
* notifications
Firestore Capabilities Used
* Cloud-based storage
* Real-time data updates
* Offline persistence
* Automatic synchronisation
* Role-based security rules

9. Backend & API Integration
API Responsibilities
* Handle all CRUD operations
* Authenticate and authorize users
* Connect frontend to Firestore
* Maintain data integrity and consistency
* Support future scalability
Example API Endpoints
GET    /api/courses
POST   /api/courses
PUT    /api/courses/{id}
DELETE /api/courses/{id}

GET    /api/lessons?courseId=
POST   /api/notes
PUT    /api/notes/{id}
DELETE /api/notes/{id}

10. Explicit CRUD Mapping (Marker Evidence)
Notes Module (Student)
* Create ? POST /api/notes
* Read ? GET /api/notes?userId=
* Update ? PUT /api/notes/{id}
* Delete ? DELETE /api/notes/{id}
Course Module (Admin)
* Create courses
* Read course list
* Update course details
* Delete courses
All CRUD operations are demonstrated in the application demo and verified in Firestore.

11. State Management
Provider or Riverpod is used consistently across:
* Authentication
* Courses
* Lessons
* Quizzes
* Notes
* Progress
* Chatbot
Each feature has its own provider, ensuring clear data flow and separation of concerns.

12. Custom UI Components
The application includes multiple custom-built components, such as:
* Custom Course Card Widget
* Lesson Content Viewer
* Quiz Option Button
* Progress Indicator
* Chat Message Bubble
* Note Editor Component
These components demonstrate UI customisation beyond default widgets.

Only necessary assumption can be made based on the scenario. You can make additional assumptions based on the scenario.
In addition, you can add the appropriate items needed for the application. All of them must be relevant, accurate, and tailored to the application.
